    "options": [
      "Event Sourcing provides stronger data consistency but makes scaling reads harder",
      "Event Sourcing stores a log of state changes rather than the current state, complicating data reconstruction",
      "Event Sourcing cannot be implemented with relational databases",
      "Event Sourcing eliminates the need for a message queue"
    ],
    "answer": "Event Sourcing stores a log of state changes rather than the current state, complicating data reconstruction",
    "explanation": "Event Sourcing persists the sequence of state-changing events. The trade-off is increased complexity in reading the current state (requires replaying events) compared to simply querying a record in CRUD.",

    ],
    "answer": "Tail latency represents the experience of the most frustrated users, directly impacting retention",
    "explanation": "Averages hide outliers. Even if average latency is 100ms, if P99 is 2s, 1% of users have a broken experience. In high-scale systems, 1% is a massive number of affected users.",

    "answer": "Consistent hashing minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when nodes are added or removed",

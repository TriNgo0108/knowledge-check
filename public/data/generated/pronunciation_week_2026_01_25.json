    "explanation": "Agentic AI implies a higher level of autonomy and decision-making.

    "explanation": "While a diphthong is a glide from one vowel to another, a triphthong is a complex glide that moves through three vowel qualities (e.g., /aɪə/ in 'fire'). It is essentially a diphthong followed immediately by a schwa, creating a rapid sequence of three target positions.",

    "answer": "Mud",
    "explanation": "The word 'Mud' is associated with the /ʌ/ sound in the text. 'Pack' and 'Sand' contain the /æ/ sound. Distinguishing /æ/ from /ʌ/ (as in 'cat' vs 'cut') is a common challenge for learners, illustrating the importance of specific symbol recognition.",

    "question": "The source text lists 'Diacritics' as a category on the IPA chart. What is the function of a diacritic in phonetic transcription?",
    "options": [
      "To represent a completely new consonant sound not found in the base chart",
      "To modify the articulation of a base symbol (e.g., indicating length, aspiration, or nasalization)",
      "To replace the need for vowels in a word",
      "To indicate the grammatical part of speech of a word"
    ],
    "answer": "To modify the articulation of a base symbol (e.g., indicating length, aspiration, or nasalization)",
    "explanation": "Diacritics are small marks added to IPA symbols to provide more specific detail (narrow transcription). For example, a ː marks length (as in iː) or a ʰ marks aspiration. They refine the basic sound.",

    "answer": "Intonation and stress patterns",

      "It is a backing diphthong moving towards the back of the mouth"

    "answer": "It is a centering diphthong moving towards the central vowel /ə/",
    "explanation": "In British English phonology, diphthongs ending in /ə/ (such as /ɪə/, /eə/, /ʊə/) are known as centering diphthongs because the tongue glides from the starting position towards the center of the mouth where the schwa /ə/ is produced.",

    "options": [
      "The 'ough' sequence always represents the diphthong /əʊ/",
      "English spelling is a phonetic system where one letter equals one sound",

    ],
    "answer": "The same graphemic sequence can represent multiple distinct phonemic realizations",
    "explanation": "The 'ough' spelling is one of the most inconsistent in English, representing /uː/ in 'through', /əʊ/ in 'though', and /ʌf/ in 'tough'. This supports the text's assertion that IPA is essential because spelling often fails to predict pronunciation.",

    "answer": "Vowel length and tongue height (tense/lax distinction)",
    "explanation": "While the IPA length marker (:) explicitly indicates length, /i:/ is a tense (close) vowel, whereas /ɪ/ is a lax (near-close) vowel. The difference involves both the duration of the sound and the exact position/height of the tongue.",

    "answer": "A monophthongization error",

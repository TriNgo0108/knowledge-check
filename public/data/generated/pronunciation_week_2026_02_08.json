    "answer": "Coalescence (Yod-coalescence)",
    "explanation": "Coalescence occurs when two adjacent sounds merge to form a new, different sound (a third place of articulation). Here, the alveolar /s/ or /t/ merges with the palatal /j/ to create the palato-alveolar /ʃ/ or /tʃ/.",

    "question": "In terms of sonority, why is the sequence /tl/ (as found in the pronunciation of 'atlas' by some speakers) considered marked or unusual in English syllable onsets?",
    "options": [
      "It violates the Sonority Sequencing Principle by placing a less sonorous sound (/t/) next to the nucleus.",
      "It violates the Sonority Sequencing Principle by having a decrease in sonority within the onset.",
      "It is impossible to articulate without an intervening vowel.",
      "The consonant /l/ is too sonorous to follow the obstruent /t/."
    ],
    "answer": "It violates the Sonority Sequencing Principle by having a decrease in sonority within the onset.",
    "explanation": "The Sonority Sequencing Principle requires sonority to rise towards the nucleus. In /tl/, the sonority drops from the voiceless stop /t/ to the more sonorous liquid /l/ (or rather, /l/ is more sonorous but typically requires a rise from the onset). English typically prefers voiced obstruents before liquids (e.g., /bl/, /gl/), allowing voiceless clusters only if they are complex onsets where sonority rises (which /tl/ does not do naturally without a schwa).",

    "answer": "The amplitude of voicing (harmonics) during the constriction.",

    "answer": "Region",
    "explanation": "Most '-ion' words are stressed on the syllable immediately preceding the suffix (penultimate). 'Region' /ˈriːdʒən/ is stressed on the initial syllable (antepenultimate) due to the stress-attracting nature of /dʒ/ in the root or the retention of historical stress patterns.",

    "explanation": "Weak forms (e.g., 'from' /frəm/) use the schwa and are unstressed. Strong forms (e.g., 'from' /frɒm/) are used when the word is stressed, accented, or stranded at the end of a sentence.",

    ],
    "answer": "A complex cluster is formed, and the syllable count reduces by one (syncope).",
    "explanation": "The schwa is deleted (syncope), allowing the surrounding consonants to form a cluster (e.g., 'family' pronounced as /ˈfæm.li/). This simplifies the rhythm by removing the unstressed syllable.",

    "explanation": "In 'night rate', the /t/ is usually a true stop [t] or [ʔ] because it starts a new syllable. In 'nitrate', the /t/ is often flapped [ɾ] or realized as [ɾɹ] because it is tautosyllabic with the preceding /ai/ and links to the /r/.",

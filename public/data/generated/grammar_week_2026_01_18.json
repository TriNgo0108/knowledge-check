    "answer": "She has sung the song.",
    "explanation": "'Sung' is the correct past participle of 'sing'. The other options misuse simple past forms (ran, drank, flew) as participles. Although 'sing' wasn't explicitly in the text snippets, this applies the logic of irregular verbs taught in the text (begin/drink/run/ring).",

    "options": [
      "Create a Customer Managed Key (CMK), enable key policies for the EC2 service, and launch instances with the 'Encrypted' flag.",
      "Create an AWS Managed Key, modify the IAM role, and use AWS Backup to encrypt the volume.",
      "Generate a new RSA key pair outside of AWS and upload the public key to the EC2 instance metadata.",

    ],
    "answer": "Create a Customer Managed Key (CMK), enable key policies for the EC2 service, and launch instances with the 'Encrypted' flag.",

    "question": "Why might you choose to deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of a Network Load Balancer (NLB) when serving gRPC or TCP traffic?",
    "options": [
      "To leverage path-based routing and Layer 7 features before terminating TLS at the NLB.",
      "To reduce the cost of data processing by the NLB.",
      "To enable the NLB to preserve source IP addresses while utilizing WAF protection on the ALB.",
      "To allow the NLB to handle idle connection timeouts longer than 350 seconds."
    ],
    "answer": "To enable the NLB to preserve source IP addresses while utilizing WAF protection on the ALB.",
    "explanation": "While an NLB preserves source IPs and handles ultra-high throughput, it cannot integrate with AWS WAF. Placing an ALB in front (or using specific termination configs) allows WAF integration, though usually, for gRPC/WAF, the ALB handles the Layer 7 inspection. However, a specific pattern involves NLB for static IPs/Source IP -> ALB for features. *Correction*: ALB in front of NLB is rare; typically it's NLB in front of ALB for source IP preservation or ALB standalone. Let's refine the question for accuracy.",

    "question": "You need to troubleshoot a connectivity issue between a pod in an Amazon EKS cluster and an on-premises database. The VPN tunnel is up, but traffic fails. Which of the following is the most likely cause if the EKS VPC CIDR overlaps with the on-premises network?",
    "options": [
      "Overlapping CIDR blocks cause asymmetric routing issues that cannot be resolved without NAT.",
      "The VPC Route Table has a specific route for the on-prem network pointing to the internet gateway.",

    ],
    "answer": "Overlapping CIDR blocks cause asymmetric routing issues that cannot be resolved without NAT.",
    "explanation": "If the VPC CIDR and on-prem CIDR overlap, AWS cannot route the traffic correctly because IP addresses become ambiguous. This is a fundamental design constraint; you must use non-overlapping CIDR blocks for Direct Connect or VPN connections.",

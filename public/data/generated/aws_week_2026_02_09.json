    "answer": "Use Amazon EFS attached to the Lambda function to process the file",
    "explanation": "Lambda ephemeral storage (/tmp) maxes out at 10 GB. Amazon EFS allows Lambda to mount a file system with virtually unlimited storage, enabling it to process large files without downloading them entirely into local memory or restrictive storage.

    ],
    "answer": "It has its own provisioned read and write capacity units (or on-demand)",

Simply granting 's3:PutObject' results in the uploader retaining ownership. 'Bucket Owner Enforced' disables ACLs entirely, which can block cross-account uploads if not managed via IAM policies, but the ACL method is the specific condition for ownership transfer.",

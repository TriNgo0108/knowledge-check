    ],
    "answer": "By defining clear operational limits and escalation paths that trigger human intervention for high-stakes or edge-case decisions.",
    "explanation": "Bounded autonomy acknowledges that while agents can operate independently, they must operate within constraints. This architecture sets predefined boundaries for what actions an agent can take autonomously and establishes clear protocols (escalation paths) for when the agent encounters a situation that exceeds its authority or confidence, ensuring humans retain control over critical business outcomes.",

    "answer": "To standardize agent-to-agent communication, allowing agents from different vendors and architectures to collaborate and share context seamlessly.",
    "explanation": "As the ecosystem grows, interoperability becomes a bottleneck. Protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol), ACP (Agent Context Protocol), and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) provide the standardized 'language' and transport layers that enable diverse agents to work together.

      "Humans provide feedback only on edge cases and errors, allowing the agent to learn from these corrections and handle routine cases autonomously.",

    ],
    "answer": "Humans provide feedback only on edge cases and errors, allowing the agent to learn from these corrections and handle routine cases autonomously.",
    "explanation": "Traditional approval gates create bottlenecks by requiring human input for every step. Sparse supervision optimizes this by letting agents handle the majority of routine tasks without interference. Humans intervene only when the agent flags uncertainty or an edge case. This focused feedback acts as a high-quality signal for the agent to learn and improve, scaling human oversight far more effectively than linear approval processes.",

    "answer": "Because LLMs are priced per token, and agents autonomously decide how many API calls to make, leading to potentially runaway costs if not constrained.",
    "explanation": "Unlike traditional software with relatively fixed resource costs, agentic systems make dynamic decisions about tool usage, reasoning loops, and LLM queries at runtime.

    "answer": "The context window has a finite size and is transient; exceeding it or ending the session results in the loss of critical progress and context.",
    "explanation": "The LLM context window is a short-term memory buffer with a strict token limit. In complex, multi-step tasks, the history of interactions can quickly exceed this limit (truncating earlier context) or be lost if the session resets.

    "explanation": "Deterministic software produces the same output for the same input, making bugs reproducible and easier to trace. Agents, however, use probabilistic reasoning which can yield different results for similar inputs.

    ],
    "answer": "It signals a shift from agents as standalone chatbots to ubiquitous, integrated components within standard business software.",
    "explanation": "The jump from less than 5% to 40% indicates mainstream adoption.

      "Tools must be designed to be idempotent and reversible wherever possible, to allow recovery from unintended agent actions.",
      "Tools must provide unlimited access to all system data to maximize the agent's reasoning capabilities.",

    ],
    "answer": "Tools must be designed to be idempotent and reversible wherever possible, to allow recovery from unintended agent actions.",
    "explanation": "Since agents can take actions autonomously based on probabilistic reasoning, they may occasionally execute the wrong tool or parameters. Designing tools that are idempotent (producing the same result even if called multiple times) and reversible (supporting rollback) creates a safety net.

    "answer": "It implies a continuous, lightweight adjustment of decision-making logic and behavior based on real-time feedback loops without full model re-deployment.",
    "explanation": "Traditional retraining is a heavy, batch-oriented process. Adaptability in agents refers to the ability to learn from immediate interactions and feedback loops dynamically.

    "explanation": "By decoupling the reasoning logic from the language model, the agent core becomes model-agnostic.

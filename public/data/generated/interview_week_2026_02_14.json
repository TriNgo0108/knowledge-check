      "Describing the failure but immediately pivoting to how the team fixed it",
      "Explaining that the failure was due to external constraints or lack of resources",
      "Focusing on the ownership of the mistake and the process changes implemented to prevent recurrence",
      "Choosing a minor technical mistake that had no business impact"
    ],
    "answer": "Focusing on the ownership of the mistake and the process changes implemented to prevent recurrence",
    "explanation": "Senior engineers are defined by their ability to learn and improve systems. Focusing on the preventative process change (blameless post-mortem culture) shows high-level maturity and engineering responsibility.",

    "options": [
      "To perform automatic failover in the event of a primary node crash",

      "To enforce foreign key constraints across different shards"
    ],
    "answer": "To distribute read traffic and reduce load on the primary write node",
    "explanation": "Read replicas accept only read operations. They allow horizontal scaling of read capacity (analytics, dashboarding, user profile views) while the primary node handles transactional writes.",

    "question": "When evaluating a candidate's 'Tell me about yourself' answer, what differentiates a junior response from a senior one?",
    "options": [
      "The senior response includes a chronological history of every job held",
      "The senior response focuses on recent hobbies and interests to build rapport",
      "The senior response is a narrative summary of value delivered and growth, tailored to the role",
      "The senior response is kept strictly under 30 seconds"
    ],
    "answer": "The senior response is a narrative summary of value delivered and growth, tailored to the role",
    "explanation": "Seniors understand that this is an elevator pitch. They synthesize their experience into themes (e.g., scaling, reliability) that align with the specific job description, rather than reciting a resume.",

      "The replication of write logs to backup servers"
    ],
    "answer": "The phenomenon of writing data multiple times to different storage levels during compaction",
    "explanation": "In Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees, data is written to a memtable and then flushed to SSTables on disk. Compaction merges and rewrites these files, often resulting in more total disk I/O than the size of the actual data.",

    ],
    "answer": "To rapidly determine if an element is definitely not in a set, reducing unnecessary disk reads",
    "explanation": "A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure. If it says 'No', the item is definitely not there. This saves expensive disk I/O by avoiding lookups for non-existent keys.",

    ],
    "answer": "Only when the team size exceeds the 'Two-Pizza' rule or distinct scaling needs emerge",

    "question": "What is the 'Leaky Bucket' algorithm's defining characteristic compared to the 'Token Bucket' rate limiting algorithm?",
    "options": [
      "It allows bursts of traffic up to the bucket capacity before smoothing output",
      "It processes requests at a fixed, steady rate regardless of incoming burst sizes",
      "It requires a distributed lock to function correctly",
      "It is primarily used for database connection pooling"
    ],
    "answer": "It processes requests at a fixed, steady rate regardless of incoming burst sizes",
    "explanation": "The Leaky Bucket enforces a constant processing rate (the leak). If the bucket fills up, excess requests overflow (are dropped), smoothing traffic but rejecting bursts, whereas Token Bucket allows short bursts.",

      "Your knowledge of company policy and hierarchy"
    ],
    "answer": "Your ability to navigate conflict, disagree respectfully, and commit to a decision",

    ],
    "answer": "Minimizing the number of keys that need to be remapped when nodes are added or removed",
    "explanation": "Standard hashing requires re-mapping almost all keys if the number of nodes changes. Consistent hashing maps both keys and nodes to a ring, ensuring that adding/removing a node only affects the keys adjacent to it.",

    ],
    "answer": "An object that knows too much or does too much, creating high coupling and low cohesion",
    "explanation": "God Objects (or Monoliths taken to the extreme) centralize too much logic. This makes the code hard to test, difficult to maintain, and creates a nightmare for concurrency and scaling.",

    "answer": "A Min-Heap of size K",
    "explanation": "Maintaining a Max-Heap of all N items is O(N) space. A Min-Heap of size K allows you to process items in O(log K) time: if a new item is larger than the smallest item in the heap, you pop the smallest and push the new one.",

    "answer": "To ensure atomicity of a transaction across multiple distributed nodes",

      "It automatically shards the database tables"
    ],
    "answer": "It reduces the overhead of establishing a new TCP connection and authentication for every request",

    "options": [
      "Base62 requires more storage space than hashing",
      "Hashing allows for predictable sequential URLs, while Base62 does not",
      "Hashing can result in collisions, whereas a unique base62 ID generated by KGS is collision-free",
      "Base62 cannot handle high write throughput"
    ],
    "answer": "Hashing can result in collisions, whereas a unique base62 ID generated by KGS is collision-free",
    "explanation": "Hashing a URL requires checking for collisions (handling them is complex). Using a distributed Key Generation Service (KGS) to pre-generate unique IDs (Base62) ensures no collisions and offers better performance for write-heavy systems.",

    "options": [
      "SQL Joins are not supported by most relational databases",

    ],
    "answer": "Joins require cross-shard communication (fan-out), which is prohibitively expensive and slow",
    "explanation": "When data is sharded, related rows may reside on different physical servers. Performing a join requires fetching data to a central layer or broadcasting data across shards, destroying performance.",

    "options": [
      "It increases initially but stabilizes once the team learns the syntax",
      "It has no measurable impact on speed but improves code readability",

      "It eliminates the need for code reviews entirely"
    ],
    "answer": "It cuts remediation time in half when combined with proper conventions",
    "explanation": "Experience from distributed TypeScript teams shows that adopting type-driven design practices—specifically conventions and automation—can cut remediation time in half as teams grow past 15 engineers. This efficiency gain comes from the type system catching errors early and clarifying the intended design.",

    ],
    "answer": "They scale together, guided by the same type system without manual schema synchronization",
    "explanation": "tRPC enables the client and server to 'scale together' because they are guided by the same type system.

    "answer": "It limits the potential for scalable refactoring and fails to leverage the system as a source of truth",
    "explanation": "Treating types only as documentation misses the core value of Type-Driven Design.

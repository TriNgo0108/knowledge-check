    "question": "Why is the integration of 'logging and monitoring' considered superior to simple `print` statements in enterprise Python applications?",
    "options": [
      "Logging offers configurable severity levels, output destinations, and timestamps without modifying code logic",
      "Print statements are faster to execute than logging module calls",
      "Logging requires less memory to store output strings",
      "Print statements automatically format data as JSON"
    ],
    "answer": "Logging offers configurable severity levels, output destinations, and timestamps without modifying code logic",
    "explanation": "The `logging` module provides structured metadata (timestamps, severity levels), allows output to be routed to files or external services, and can be toggled via configuration, whereas `print` statements are rigid and hard to manage in production.",

      "Broker Nodes handle data storage and transfer, while Zookeeper Nodes manage cluster metadata and controller election",
      "Zookeeper Nodes are responsible for replicating data across AZs, while Broker Nodes handle client connections",
      "Broker Nodes perform leader election, while Zookeeper Nodes act as the Kafka consumers",
      "There is no distinction; Amazon MSK abstracts Zookeeper and only manages Broker Nodes"
    ],
    "answer": "Broker Nodes handle data storage and transfer, while Zookeeper Nodes manage cluster metadata and controller election",
    "explanation": "In Kafka, Brokers are the servers that store data and serve clients. Zookeeper is responsible for maintaining the consensus on the state of the cluster (controller election, topic listing, ACLs), though newer versions of Kafka (KRaft mode) aim to remove this dependency.",

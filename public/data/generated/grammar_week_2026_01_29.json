    "explanation": "The text provides a specific correction for this exact error. 'Lain' is the past participle of 'lie' (intransitive). 'Laid' is the past participle of 'lay' (transitive, e.g., laying an object), making 'Dad has laid' incorrect.",

    "explanation": "'Patience' is an uncountable (abstract) quantity, so 'less' is correct. 'People' and 'mistakes' are countable, requiring 'fewer' (not 'less'). 'Water' is uncountable, so it requires 'less' (not 'fewer'). Only Option C correctly pairs an uncountable noun with 'less'.",

      "Dangling modifier",
      "Incorrect preposition usage",

    "explanation": "The introductory phrase 'Walking down the street' modifies the subject of the main clause. Grammatically, it implies the *trees* were walking.

      "I like this sort of apple.",
      "I like these sorts of apples."
    ],
    "answer": "I like this sort of apple.",
    "explanation": "When 'this' (singular demonstrative) is used, 'sort' must be singular ('this sort'). Furthermore, the noun following 'of' should logically match the singular nature of the specific sort being referenced if implying a category, or match the intent. However, the text specifically corrects 'this sort of meat pies' to 'this sort of meat pie' (singular) to match the singular 'sort'. Option D changes the demonstrative to plural, which changes the meaning slightly from 'this specific type' to 'these types'. The most direct structural fix for the singular 'this sort' is often making the following noun singular or ensuring the type is singular. Based on the example 'I don't like this sort of meat pie', Option C is the grammatical pattern.",

    "answer": "The corporation is a large player in the market.",
    "explanation": "The guide notes that 'large' is generally preferred over 'big' in formal styles, although both are used with concrete nouns. While 'corporation' can be abstract or concrete, 'large' is the formal choice for size in professional or formal writing contexts. 'Great' implies quality, not size. 'Big' is informal. 'Biggest' requires the definite article 'the biggest'.",

    "answer": "The papers lie scattered on the floor.",
    "explanation": "'Lie' is intransitive, meaning it does not take a direct object. In 'The papers lie scattered', the papers are not being acted upon by an object; they are simply resting.

    "explanation": "The SAT emphasizes clear pronoun usage. 'They' is plural and creates ambiguity about who needs to study (the teacher or the student). 'He' (or 'she') provides a singular, clear antecedent. Option B uses 'it' incorrectly for a person. Option D uses 'whom' as a subject pronoun, which is grammatically incorrect ('who' is the subject form).",

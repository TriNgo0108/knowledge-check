Prioritizing flexibility allows the system to adapt to rapid changes in AI workloads and business requirements. Immediate performance tuning can create rigid systems that break under new types of load, whereas scalable, flexible architectures support the integration of intelligent workloads. Option A is factually incorrect regarding hardware. Option C is a specific security concern not directly linked to this general trade-off. Option D is incorrect as flexibility often incurs initial cost overhead.",

    "answer": "AI is moving from a central experimental layer to a decentralized operational function that drives core value",
    "explanation": "The text states, 'Artificial intelligence is no longer an experimental layer sitting on the side.

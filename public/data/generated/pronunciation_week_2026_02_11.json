    "answer": "Th-fronting",
    "explanation": "Th-fronting is the shift of dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/ to labiodental fricatives /f/ and /v/. Th-stopping converts them to stops (e.g., /t/ or /d/); debuccalization shifts them to glottals.",

    "question": "In the context of the IPA chart, how are affricates classified?",
    "options": [
      "As single symbols representing a stop followed immediately by a fricative at the same place of articulation",

      "As vowels with consonantal transitions"
    ],
    "answer": "As single symbols representing a stop followed immediately by a fricative at the same place of articulation",
    "explanation": "Affricates like /tʃ/ and /dʒ/ have dedicated IPA symbols (ʧ, ʤ) that function as single phonemes, though they are phonetically composed of a stop plus a fricative homorganic. While a tie bar can be used for non-standard affricates, the standard symbols are single units.",

      "It calls `valueOf()` first; if the result is not a primitive, it calls `toString()`",
      "It calls `toString()` first; if the result is not a primitive, it calls `valueOf()`",
      "It calls `Symbol.toPrimitive` directly, ignoring `valueOf` and `toString`",
      "It throws a TypeError immediately"
    ],
    "answer": "It calls `valueOf()` first; if the result is not a primitive, it calls `toString()`",
    "explanation": "With a `Number` hint (such as in math operations), `ToPrimitive` attempts `valueOf()` first. If `valueOf()` does not return a primitive, it falls back to `toString()`. For a `String` hint (like string concatenation), the order is reversed.",

    "question": "In a Promise chain, what causes a 'rejection handler' to be executed if no `.catch()` is explicitly attached to the specific promise?",
    "options": [
      "The error bubbles to the global scope and halts execution",
      "The rejection is forwarded to the next `then` in the chain",
      "The rejection is captured by the global `unhandledrejection` event",
      "The error is silently ignored and garbage collected"
    ],
    "answer": "The rejection is captured by the global `unhandledrejection` event",
    "explanation": "If a Promise rejects and no handler is available at the end of the chain, the rejection is considered 'unhandled'. In Node.js and browsers, this typically triggers the `unhandledrejection` event on the global object (process or window).",

    "answer": "It automatically wraps the return value in a Promise",

    "explanation": "JavaScript uses IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format. Just as 1/3 cannot be represented precisely in base-10 (0.333...), 1/10 and 2/10 cannot be represented precisely in binary, leading to a tiny precision error.",

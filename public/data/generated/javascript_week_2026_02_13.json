    "answer": "The optimized code is deoptimized (discarded) and execution reverts to bytecode.",

    "answer": "It optimizes collection speed by focusing on short-lived objects (die young) in the Young Generation.",

    "answer": "There is no technical difference; `async/await` is syntactic sugar over Promises.",

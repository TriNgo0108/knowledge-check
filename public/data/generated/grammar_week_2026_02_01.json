    "answer": "I was given the book by the teacher.",
    "explanation": "This correctly converts 'The teacher gave me the book' to the passive, where the indirect object ('me') becomes the subject. Option A is valid passive, but Option D is the standard conversion for the indirect object focus; however, looking closer, Option D is a valid passive construction, but Option A is also valid. Wait, 'The book was given to me' makes 'book' the subject. 'I was given the book' makes 'me' the subject. Both are correct passives. Let me refine the options to force a specific answer.\nCorrection: The question asks which employs the passive voice correctly. Both A and D are technically correct passive forms of ditransitive sentences (Subject promotion vs Indirect Object promotion). However, usually 'I was given the book' is the less formally marked shift in some dialects, but 'The book was given to me' is strictly correct.\nLet's change options to make one clearly incorrect or less preferred.\nActually, 'The teacher was given the book' (B) implies the teacher received it? No, that changes meaning.\nLet's stick to the most direct passive conversion of a double object construction.\nOption D: 'I was given the book' is the standard indirect object passive.\nOption A: 'The book was given to me' is the direct object passive.\nBoth are correct. I will remove one.\nRevised Option C: 'The book was gave to the teacher' (Wrong tense).\nRevised Option B: 'The teacher was given the book by me' (Active voice 'was given'? No, that's passive. But it implies the teacher received it? No, 'The teacher gave me the book' -> 'The book was given to me' or 'I was given the book'.\nIf the active is 'He gave her a present'.\nPassive 1: 'A present was given to her'.\nPassive 2: 'She was given a present'.\nLet's look at Option B again: 'The teacher was given the book by me'. This means 'I gave the teacher the book'. That is a valid passive sentence.\nSo A, B, and D are all valid passive sentences depending on the original active meaning.\nA: Active: Teacher gave me book.\nD: Active: Teacher gave me book.\nB: Active: I gave teacher book.\nI need to distinguish.\nLet's check 'given'. 'Given' is the past participle.\nLet's try a different grammatical point.\nLet's test 'Need' as a modal vs main verb.\n'You need not go' vs 'You don't need to go'.",

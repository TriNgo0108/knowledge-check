    "answer": "Spot Instances",
    "explanation": "Spot Instances provide significant savings (up to 90%) for fault-tolerant, interruptible workloads. If a job is interrupted, Spot can be configured to stop or terminate, but with a fallback to On-Demand or checkpointing, it is the most cost-effective for this scenario.

    "explanation": "Prefix Delegation allows a single ENI to assign multiple IP addresses (prefixes) to pods, increasing pod density and ensuring IPs are part of the VPC CIDR. If a pod moves, it can theoretically retain the IP if the logic allows, but specifically, it improves IP management for stateful apps compared to standard one-IP-per-ENI limits.

The technically accurate answer for *keeping the EIP* is using the ENI reattachment strategy, but NLB is the *best practice* for high availability.

    "explanation": "When you create an ALIAS record for an AWS resource (like an NLB or CloudFront) that supports dual-stack, Route 53 allows you to select the record type (A or AAAA). You generally create two alias records (one A, one AAAA) pointing to the same target if you want explicit control, but 'Select IP Address Type' in the console handles this. Actually, looking at the docs: You create an alias record. If the target is dual-stack, Route 53 resolves it. But for specific 'AAAA' response, you typically create a record of type AAAA. The 'trick' in professional exams is often that you must create *two* alias records if you want to support both explicitly on the same hostname (RRset). Let's verify. AWS Doc: 'You can create an alias record that routes traffic to a Network Load Balancer... If your load balancer is configured with IPv6 addresses, you create an AAAA alias record.' You cannot return both A and AAAA in a single RRset for an Alias in a single record definition usually, unless the UI wizard does it. The most precise technical answer is creating two records (one A, one AAAA) or relying on the UI which asks 'Do you want to specify an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address?'.

Read Replicas (Single-AZ) are available for reads but are *asynchronous*. There is no 'read replica consistency' feature in RDS MySQL that makes async replicas sync. Therefore, to offload read traffic *while maintaining sync consistency*, you generally cannot use the Multi-AZ standby for reads. However, if the question asks for offloading *reads*, the standard answer is Read Replicas. But the 'sync consistency' requirement makes this a trick. If sync is required for 'certain queries', they must hit the primary. The question asks how to offload *while* ensuring sync for *certain* (implying *some*) queries. If the question implies ALL reads must be sync, you can't offload. But RDS Feature 'Read Replica' is the standard offload. Let's re-read carefully. 'Offload read traffic... while ensuring... sync... for certain critical queries'. This implies critical queries hit primary, others can hit replicas. The option 'Use Read Replicas and enable Read Replica Consistency' is the trap (AWS Aurora offers this, RDS MySQL does not). The option 'Use Multi-AZ... and change DNS' does not allow reading the standby. Let's switch to Aurora logic. If the DB was Aurora, you can use the Reader Endpoint. For RDS MySQL, you just send critical to Primary, reporting to Replica. Let's frame the question to target *Aurora Serverless v2* or specific Aurora features to make it valid 'Professional' level.

    "answer": "Rule condition based on 'Http Header' with field 'X-User-ID'",
    "explanation": "ALB supports listener rules that evaluate conditions including HTTP Headers, Query Strings, and Path patterns. To route based on 'X-User-ID', you configure a rule condition checking the value of that specific header.",

    "question": "You have an Amazon ECS cluster running tasks that need to access a service in a peered VPC. You want to ensure that the source IP seen by the service in the peered VPC is the private IP of the ECS task, not the NAT Gateway IP. Which networking mode achieves this?",
    "options": [
      "awsvpc network mode",
      "bridge network mode",
      "host network mode",
      "none network mode"
    ],
    "answer": "awsvpc network mode",
    "explanation": "The 'awsvpc' networking mode assigns each task its own Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in the VPC. This gives the task a unique private IP and allows it to route directly to peered VPCs without traversing a NAT Gateway, whereas 'bridge' or 'host' modes rely on the EC2 instance's network stack.",

    "question": "You are configuring an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator. You want to ensure that client traffic from Europe is routed to the endpoint in Europe, but if that endpoint fails, it should failover to the US endpoint. Which listener configuration achieves this?",
    "options": [
      "Port 443 with Protocol TCP and Endpoint Groups weighted 100/0",
      "Port 443 with Protocol TCP and Endpoint Groups weighted 100/100 with Health Checks",
      "Port 80 with Protocol UDP and Client IP preservation",
      "Static IP routing with BGP advertisements"
    ],
    "answer": "Port 443 with Protocol TCP and Endpoint Groups weighted 100/100 with Health Checks",
    "explanation": "AWS Global Accelerator uses Endpoint Groups to define regions. Traffic is routed to the group with the *closest* (lowest latency) healthy endpoint. If you set weights for specific routing preference or just rely on default proximity, you must ensure Health Checks are active so Global Accelerator stops routing to the failed EU group and moves traffic to the US group.",

    "question": "You need to enforce a policy that prevents any S3 bucket in the AWS account from publicly serving objects (either via ACLs or Policies). The enforcement must happen *before* the configuration is saved to prevent accidental exposure. Which service provides this preventative control?",
    "options": [
      "AWS Config Reactive Rules",
      "AWS Shield Advanced",
      "Amazon Macie",
      "AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)"
    ],
    "answer": "AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)",
    "explanation": "SCPs are used in AWS Organizations to set maximum permission boundaries. An SCP can deny actions like `s3:PutBucketPolicy` or `s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock` conditions, effectively preventing users from making configurations that violate security rules. AWS Config is reactive (detects after the fact).",

    "question": "You are migrating a large Oracle database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL using AWS DMS (Database Migration Service). The Oracle database has LOB columns that are larger than 1GB. Which DMS task setting is critical to ensure these large LOBs are migrated correctly?",
    "options": [
      "Enable 'Full LOB mode'",
      "Set 'Max LOB size' to 0",
      "Use 'Limited LOB mode' with size 64 MB",
      "Enable 'Transaction consistency' only"
    ],
    "answer": "Enable 'Full LOB mode'",
    "explanation": "In AWS DMS, 'Limited LOB mode' truncates LOBs at a specific size. To migrate LOBs larger than the default 64MB (or any LOB regardless of size if you need full fidelity), you must enable 'Full LOB mode' so DMS retrieves the entire LOB content from the source.",

    "question": "A VPC has two subnets: one public and one private. Instances in the private subnet must initiate outbound traffic to the internet. However, they must not receive unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet. Which architecture component satisfies this requirement?",
    "options": [
      "A NAT Gateway in the private subnet",
      "A NAT Gateway in the public subnet with a route from 0.0.0.0/0 in the private subnet route table",
      "An Internet Gateway attached to the VPC",
      "A VPC Peering connection"
    ],
    "answer": "A NAT Gateway in the public subnet with a route from 0.0.0.0/0 in the private subnet route table",
    "explanation": "A NAT Gateway (NAT) resides in a public subnet to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets. It uses source network address translation, which masks the private IP and does not allow inbound connections initiated from the internet. Routing 0.0.0.0/0 to the Internet Gateway in the private route table would give the instance a public IP (if it had one) but implies direct connectivity, whereas NAT is the standard obfuscation method.",

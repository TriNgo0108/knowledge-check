    ],
    "answer": "To implement incremental rendering and allow React to pause, abort, or resume work",

    ],
    "answer": "If left empty [], the effect runs only once on mount and unmount (cleanup)",
    "explanation": "Passing an empty dependency array tells React that this effect does not depend on any props or state, so it never needs to re-run after the initial mount.",

    "question": "When constructing a 'risk parity' portfolio, how is capital typically allocated compared to a traditional 60/40 portfolio?",
    "options": [
      "Capital is allocated equally across all asset classes",
      "Capital is weighted by market capitalization",
      "Capital is allocated so that each asset contributes an equal amount of risk (volatility) to the portfolio",
      "Capital is allocated 100% to bonds to minimize volatility"
    ],
    "answer": "Capital is allocated so that each asset contributes an equal amount of risk (volatility) to the portfolio",
    "explanation": "Risk parity focuses on risk contribution rather than dollar contribution. To equalize risk, lower-volatility assets (like bonds) often require significantly higher capital allocations than high-volatility assets (like stocks).",

      "void",
      "never"
    ],
    "answer": "undefined",
    "explanation": "`undefined` is the default value of uninitialized variables in JavaScript and TypeScript. `null` represents a deliberate absence of value, while `void` is used for function return types.",

    "answer": "Interfaces support declaration merging; types do not",
    "explanation": "Interfaces can be declared multiple times with the same name, and their definitions will be merged into a single definition. Type aliases cannot be merged and must be unique.",

    ],
    "answer": "Pick",
    "explanation": "`Pick<T, K>` constructs a type by selecting the specific set of keys `K` from `T`. `Omit` does the opposite by removing keys, and `Partial` makes all keys optional.",

    "explanation": "The superscript [ ʷ ] denotes labialization (lip rounding). [ ʲ ] denotes palatalization, [ ˠ ] denotes velarization, and [ ̴ ] denotes velarization or pharyngealization depending on the context (often rhotacization in Americanist tradition).",

    "question": "What distinguishes a 'Narrow Diphthong' from a 'Wide Diphthong'?",
    "options": [
      "Narrow diphthongs involve a large tongue height change, while wide diphthongs involve a small change",
      "Narrow diphthongs involve a small movement in vowel space (e.g., /eɪ/), while wide diphthongs involve a large movement (e.g., /aɪ/)",
      "Narrow diphthongs are found in American English, while wide diphthongs are British",
      "Narrow diphthongs are closing, wide diphthongs are centering"
    ],
    "answer": "Narrow diphthongs involve a small movement in vowel space (e.g., /eɪ/), while wide diphthongs involve a large movement (e.g., /aɪ/)",
    "explanation": "The distinction refers to the distance between the starting and ending points of the tongue articulation in the vowel chart. /eɪ/ is a narrow (closing) diphthong, while /aɪ/ or /ɔɪ/ are considered wide diphthongs due to the extreme tongue movement.",

    "question": "In the study of rhythm, what is the isochrony hypothesis?",
    "options": [
      "All languages speak at the same speed",
      "Stress-timed languages have equal intervals between stresses, while syllable-timed languages have equal syllable durations",
      "Vowels are always longer than consonants",
      "Intonation contours reset at regular time intervals"
    ],
    "answer": "Stress-timed languages have equal intervals between stresses, while syllable-timed languages have equal syllable durations",
    "explanation": "The hypothesis suggests rhythm classes: 'Stress-timed' languages (like English) attempt to keep inter-stress intervals constant (varying vowel durations), whereas 'syllable-timed' languages (like Spanish) maintain relatively equal syllable lengths.",

    ],
    "answer": "The transition or boundary between speech sounds, used to differentiate otherwise identical sequences",
    "explanation": "Juncture refers to the phonetic cues that signal boundaries between sequences of sounds. It distinguishes phrases like 'night rate' from 'nitrate' or 'a name' from 'an aim' through slight pauses or allophonic variations.",

      "Lexical Tone (pitch height/contour)",

    ],
    "answer": "Lexical Tone (pitch height/contour)",
    "explanation": "Unlike English which uses intonation contours over the phrase, Mandarin (a tone language) distinguishes statement vs question primarily by adding a sentence-final particle (e.g., 'ma') or, in certain particle-free contexts, distinct pitch expansions or modifications of the final lexical tone.",

    "answer": "A strong syllable followed by a weak syllable (sw)",

    "answer": "Devoicing",

    ],
    "answer": "The consonant forms a syllable (syllabic consonant)",
    "explanation": "The vertical line below a consonant (like [n̩] or [l̩]) indicates that the consonant itself acts as the nucleus of the syllable, replacing a vowel, as in the second syllable of 'button' or 'bottle'.",

      "Fortis consonants are always vowels"
    ],
    "answer": "Fortis consonants are voiceless and have greater length/muscular tension, Lenis are often voiced and 'weaker'",
    "explanation": "In the fortis/lenis distinction relevant to English, fortis consonants (like /p, t, k/) are voiceless and articulated with greater force. Lenis consonants (like /b, d, g/) are typically voiced (though partly devoiced in syllable-initial position) and have less muscular tension.",

    "answer": "When two adjacent sounds merge to form a new, different sound (e.g., /j/ + /z/ -> /ʒ/)",
